            After looking at some of the distros of Linux, I decided to use
	        wget to yank some data from kernel.org. I decided to get a list of
	        the linux releases in order to do some statistics.  Using
	        Perl to parse a table with the relevent data, I then ran the table
	        through R to make some bar charts and scatter plots.  The results
	        are pretty interesting.

              Taking a look at version number vs days between first and last

	      V1.0 has 0 days between the first and last release, natuarally,
	      and the other versions have no obvious pattern as to why one
	      has multiple years between changing version numbers and the other
	      has only a few weeks.  However, I noticed that the peaks in the
	      number of days matched up rather well with the peaks in the
	      number of iterations, so I decided to make a scatterplot of
	      iterations vs days.

            <p class="exp">
              Lo and behold, there is a correlation between number of
	      iterations and days between first and last released.  It's pretty
	      cool how the two are linearly correlated, especially since there
	      aren't any fixed criteria for how many releases in each version
	      there are (4 for v1.x and 20 for 3.x for example).  Furthermore,
	      there's a halfway decent correlation between the two, as I used
	      the adjusted coefficient of determination instead of the regular
	      one.  So without regard to version number, it's valid to expect
	      that as the number of iterations goes up, the days between the
	      first and last release will also go up, which is a very
	      reasonable assumption.  This is further backed up by the
	      residuals.

              Looking at the residuals, the distribution is random which
	      supports the above linear regression, coefficient, and
	      hypothesis.  Of course, correlation does not imply causation, but
	      it still is valid to expect that increasing the number of
	      iterations will cause the length of time to increase as well.
            </p>
            <p class="exp">
	      Something else of note is that this is without regard to time,
	      despite the fact that it's also reasonable to assume that
	      as the years progress, the number of iterations must also
	      increase in some way or other.  Color-coding the plot of
	      iterations vs days immediately disproves that notion (below).

              Once I color-coded it, I found that, strikingly, V2.x had the
	      most iterations, whereas 4.x, the newest, has around the same as
	      1.x, which is quite surprising.  This plot shows some
	      other interesting results, as it seems that 2.x and 3.x had quite
	      a wide spread of days between first and last release.  Of course,
	      going back up to the original bar charts shows why this is the
	      case.

              After playing with iteration vs days, I decided to look at
	      version vs average size, yielding the above.  This time,
	      something interesting happens.  Instead of being randomly
	      distributed, it seems the versions follow a polynomial or
	      exponential growth, peaking at 3.0 before leveling off into
	      linear growth.

              Although plotting iterations vs average size likely wouldn't
	      yield any decent correlations, I decided to plot it anyways.
	      However, instead of using a regular scatterplot, I color-coded
	      the points by version number.  Whereas a regular plot would've
	      yielded no correlation, the color-coded one is illuminating.
	      V1.x is near the bottom, with a low average size and a mostly
	      small number of iterations.  V2.x is relatively scattered, taking
	      up a good portion of the bottom middle, with one point way over
	      on the right.  V3.x occupies the top area, concentrated in the
	      top left.  V4.x is exclusively in the top left, with a high
	      average size and a small number of iterations.

              Color-coding days between first and last release vs average size

	      even greater.  With the exception of 2.x occupying a relatively
	      large area, the other versions are packed pretty tightly.  V1.x
	      is clustered into the bottom left, 3.x has the majority of its
	      data points in a virtual line in the top left corner, and 4.x
	      is pretty much a line.
